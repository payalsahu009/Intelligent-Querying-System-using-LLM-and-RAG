# Intelligent-Querying-System-using-LLM-and-RAG
This project integrates advanced AI technologies to create an interactive querying system for the "Indian Budget 2024-2025" document. By converting the PDF into text and employing ChromaDB for efficient vector-based storage and retrieval, the system enables precise information extraction.

Key Components:
1. Chroma Vector Database: Utilized for efficient document indexing and similarity-based retrieval, ensuring relevant information is quickly accessible.
2. LangChain Framework: Acts as a connective layer, streamlining operations between language models and vector databases for a cohesive workflow.
3. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): A hybrid architecture combining information retrieval with language generation to produce contextually rich responses.
4. Llama2-7b Parameter Model: Powers the language understanding and generation tasks, delivering coherent and context-aware answers to user queries.
